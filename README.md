A sliver that always fills the remaining space in the viewport, plus some extra height.

Similar to [SliverFillRemaining](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/SliverFillRemaining-class.html) but allows for extra height.

Convenient e.g if you have an expandable SliverAppBar, and you want the body below it to always be heigh enough to allow the SliverAppBar to collapse. (See the example how to calculate the extra height for this case).
